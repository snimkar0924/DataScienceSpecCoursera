# About this work...
## USA - State Statistics

This presentation is a part of the final course project for the Data Science Specialization (JHU) on Coursera, specifically for the course "Developing Data Products".

In this project, we use a data set provided in the base R packages - "state" and its related data sets, mainly, "state.x77", "state.abb" and "state.region". 
Given these data on some major state statistics such as area, population, income, literacy, crime etc., we look at the state-wise trend for each statistic across the 50 American states.

This is a shiny application with the ui.R and server.R loaded into this repository.
